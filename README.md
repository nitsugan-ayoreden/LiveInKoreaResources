# Living In Korea - Resources

Hi! Welcome to my repo to hold resources about living and studying in Korea!

This was mainly made for a classmate of mine. Made public for easy access, for posterity and because I thought it could probably help anyone that stumbles upon this site.

I will try to keep a book-style format (index first, with links for quick access). Keep in mind that this was mainly made for personal reasons and, as such, will probably forever be a work in progress.  
That said, if you feel like you would like to contribute by making suggestions, improvement ideas, changes and the like, you are certainly more than welcome to do so.

## Communities & Organizations

- [Refold](https://refold.la/) - This seems like a given lately. Even more so if you've been hanging out on YouTube's language learning community. To me, this seems like a great starting point to find many, many more resources. For Korea and Korean learning resources, I would recommend joining their [Discord](https://refold.la/join).  
If you're ever interested in learning other languages, you could maybe join the Refold Central, or any other language's Refold Discord for lots of resources.

- [Go! Go! Hanguk](https://gogohanguk.com/en/) - From my experience in learning Japanese, this seems like a good starting point to search for schools (especially language schools) and opportunities to go study in Korea and learning Korean.  
They seem to list a good number of options, whether it'd be study trips or exchanges. The university section is a bit lacking in my opinion (only one option?) but I would not hesitate to send them an email to see if they have any more information. From what I've heard, their Online Courses for language learning are quite good.

- [StudyinKorea](https://www.studyinkorea.go.kr/ko/main.do) - Here is a big one. This is the official website concerning studies in Korea made by the Korean Government. If you can figure out your way through the site's broken Google Translations integration (or read in Korean directly), this seems to hold most of the information I've ever seen on any other website, at least concerning the schools.

## Language Learning

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However, I would strongly recommend this method over any other if you ever find yourself with a lack vocabulary knowledge. It has proven itself for me and many others when it comes to building a strong knowledge and memory of words.  
Furthermore, your setup will depending on your needs and taste, but for easy mobile access, I would recommend to at least connect yourself with AnkiWeb and to download the AnkiWeb mobile app for reviews on the go (the actual name may vary depending on whether you're on iOS or Android).

- [TOPIK](https://www.topik.go.kr/TWMAIN/TWMAIN0010.do) - Here is the official TOPIK (or Test of Proficiency in Korean) website. If you wish to find yourself a place in a Korean university, I would advise to take the test as it could help with your admission process. If not, then at the very least, it would serve as a good way to level yourself and see if is there's any particular areas that need more improvement.

## Schools & Programs

Here are some schools that seem to offer some options for foreigners that I found while searching through the web and some the websites listed above.  
I would advise to always double-check for any programs that could seem to overcharge for what they offer.

- [Daejeon University](https://www.dju.ac.kr/en/main.do) - Seems like a welcoming university for foreigners. They seem to accept for undergraduate and graduate programs and have a Department of Broadcasting & Performing Art.

- [Dream Studies Abroad](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/study-korea) - Holds articles that are good starting points to explore many more options and opportunities. Also lists some requirements and advice on how to study to Korea as well as how to prepare for it.  
I would mainly at least consult [this](https://www.dreamstudiesabroad.com/articles/study-korea#a5) part of the article concerning the TOPIK-test suggestions. For reference, [here](https://www.topik.go.kr/TWMAIN/TWMAIN0010.do) is the TOPIK website.
- [educations.com]() - A bit of a stretch, but it allowed me to find some programs I don't think I would've found otherwise.  
Some of the programs I found were :
    - [Theatre and Film Master](https://www.educations.com/institutions/seokyeong-university/theatre-and-film-master) at SeoKyeong University in Seongbuk-gu.
    - [Master in Korean Language and Literature](https://www.educations.com/institutions/korea-national-open-university/master-in-korean-language-and-literature) at the Korea National Open University in Jongno-gu.
    - [Korean Language and Literature Master's Program](https://www.educations.com/institutions/cheongju-university/korean-language-and-literature-masters-program) at Cheongju University in Cheongju-si.
